This cotton wool is actually a parasitic fungus that infects the Pamana Bee.</p><p>When parasitized, Pamana Bees become aggressive and start feeding on meat to gather more nutrients. Even  the normally docile worker bees, except for the Nest Guards, begin to attack other creatures indiscriminately.</p><p>Parasitized bees often become solitary and rarely return to the nest. However, in some cases, they do return and contaminate the entire hive. This leads to the production of a large number of Cotton Crowns, which aggressively consume and destroy the surrounding ecosystem.</p><p>Fortunately, the range of the Cotton Crown is limited to less than one kilometer in radius, compared to the original Pamana Bee. In addition, as the fungus-infested Queens lose their ability to lay eggs, the number of infected hives gradually decreases over time.</p><p>The mycelium of this fungus is prized as a material for \"Cotton Crown Cushions\" (see <em>Natural History of Burlight</em> p. 42). Some people even risk their lives to venture into the prairie in search of Cotton Crowns, often accompanied by the search for Pamana Bee nests.</p>",

The plant is a giant flower with a radius of about 30 meters, with six petals that open in a radial pattern. Mimicry is achieved by deforming the numerous tentacles that line the petal's surface. Still, there is also an element of magical illusion, and the monster is assumed to have been modified during the Magic Civilization Period. In the center of each petal is a stamen with a greenish light at the tip. To the uninitiated, it looks like a tower of green lights that brightly illuminate the entire settlement. This light is due to the same effect as the symbiotic organisms of the Lunoicos.</p><p>During predation, the tentacles on the surface of the petals break their mimicry, bunch together, and strike at moving objects. The central stamen also attacks using its luminescent ability. The roots beneath the petals must be eliminated in order to defeat it, making it a troublesome monster that should be treated with caution.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Megalomor is a massive perennial herb that can grow several meters high with stems and leaves. It thrives in areas with heavy pollution, such as poison or dense mana, and is known to eliminate them.</p><p>It is not considered a threat unless touched, but the juice of its leaves has potent disease-curing properties. People with power and wealth sometimes hire others to collect the leaves. Megalomor sometimes grows in areas where Mako Stones can be mined in abundance because of its mana- removing properties. It is sometimes requested to be exterminated, but some Barbarous who prefer a polluted environment may try to kill it. In such cases, the plant will defend itself with all its might.</p><p>If left alone, Megalomor will eventually die out without leaving anything behind when pollution and mana levels in the environment are sufficiently reduced. How this non-flowering, non-fruit-bearing, and non-bulb- producing plant continues to grow and reappear in new places remains a mystery.</p>",

It mainly feeds on animals on the plains, but in the Dorden region, it has been observed to frequent the vicinity of railroad tracks. Studies have shown that they move along the tracks by licking the track water and oil spilled by trains, earning them the nickname \"Railway Centipedes.\" This habit is thought to be a way for them to replenish some nutrients, but this has not been proven with certainty. Because they are quite large, they often block railroad tracks and are requested to be taken down.</p><p><em>For the mount version of this creature, see Plain Centipede (mount).</em></p>",

      "description": "<p>Talos are artificial creatures believed to have been created by Barbarous and Dark Dwarves. These creatures were driven underground during the era of the Ancient Magic Civilization. According to legend, Talos were made by magically mineralizing various creatures and feeding them into a furnace that could burn the ore called \"Ignis Blaze.\"</p><p>Talos resemble warriors standing about 2 meters tall. They wear tightly fitted armor and carry large swords. Their armor acts as a natural outer shell, and although they have horns, the horns grow directly from their skulls, not from their helmets. Their faces are Humanoid but lack expression.</p><p>Talos were created to fight and serve Barbarous. They are fearless and possess great combat skills. They have a general resistance to magic, and when they exert themselves, flames spew from the outer joints and gaps along the inner thigh. Because Talos is an artificial lifeform, it does not possess a soul and, therefore, does not have Soulscars. As a result, it is unaffected by Swords of Protection. However, a major weakness of Talos is its inability to perceive fairies and spirits.</p><p>During the Magic Civilization era, Talos were believed to have been extensively used. However, most of them were seemingly destroyed in the battles of that era, making them rarely seen today. Nonetheless, Talos can still be found in boxes called \"Fire's Casing\" in Magic Civilization ruins. As long as they remain within these casings, they seem to continue sleeping without aging.</p><p>Opening a Fire's Casing with the correct sequence makes an individual the master of the Talos. However, a Talos cannot survive without consuming a Humanoid heart once a year. Although not certain, there is a theory that Talos served as a motif in the foundational research of Runefolk. Some similarities can be observed between the two.</p><p>Talos Soldiers are the lowest class of mass-produced soldiers. They have minimal intelligence and lack human emotions. They mechanically follow the orders of their masters. In some cases, they are found in large numbers and are used as subordinates by Drakes.</p>",

According to tradition, Zeanemo were once Elves who were soulscarred by the god Eiryak, the Sea Snatcher.</p><p>The most notable difference from Elves in their appearance is their right eye. A Zeanemo's right eye lacks an eyeball and instead contains an anemone-like tentacle. Normally, they keep this tentacle stored in their eye socket and close their eyelids. However, during fights or when preying on their targets, they fully open their eye, revealing the flexible tentacle. This tentacle can be used as a weapon in addition to their regular attacks. It often exhibits stunning shades of pink and orange, resembling a blooming flower. To conceal their unique eye, Zeanemos sometimes wear an eye patch when their eyes are closed, making them appear more like ordinary Elves.</p><p>Zeanemo are capable of briefly venturing onto land for about an hour, but they must return to a water-rich environment or face death. They wear clothing made from plant fibers and are skilled in using various weapons. Occasionally, they don armor crafted from shells and turtle shells.</p><p>While they possess intelligence and may initially appear peaceful, their true nature is brutal and cruel, and they have a penchant for plundering. They harbor a strong animosity towards Elves and often raid their settlements, including ships crewed by Elves. Zeanemo are capable of breeding with Elves and occasionally abduct young Elves. They have a lifespan of approximately 500 years and their power increases with age.</p>",
