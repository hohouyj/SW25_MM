Even if the character has the ability to declare multiple combat feats in one round, they cannot declare an additional [Multi-Action] for additional melee attacks or spells cast.\nThe conditions for casting the spell must be met, and movement is limited to Limited Move.\nThere are some Combat Feats that allow additional actions by a character. However, all of them are outside the target of the [Multi-Action] declaration.\nMelee attacks via [Chain Attack] or [Follow-Up], kicks via [Flying Kick] or [Stomp], additional spells via [Double Cast], and additional melee attacks or spells via [Multi-Action] itself cannot be targets of the [Multi-Action] declaration.\nThe Combat Feat [Fast Action] adds a Major Action itself. Therefore, if you make a melee attack using a Major Action, you can declare [Multi-Action].\nIf the character has mastered either [Ever-Changing] or [Battle Master], it is possible to execute 2 combinations of melee attacks and spells cast by combining them with [Fast Action]. Please note that [Rune Master] cannot be used for this purpose, as [Multi-Action] does not meet the condition of [Use: Wizard-Type Classes].\nIf you have mastered [Dual Wielding] and declare [Multi-Action] when performing two melee attacks with one Major Action, you must declare [Multi-Action] for the first attack but *not* the second attack.\nIn other words, resolve attacks in this order:\nFirst Melee Attack \u2192 Cast a Spell \u2192 Second Melee Attack\nor\nCast a Spell \u2192 2 Melee Attacks\nThe two attacks of [Twin Strike] are linked by the decision to choose a target for the second attack depending on the outcome of the first attack. Therefore, when using [Multi-Action] to cast a spell along with [Twin Strike], you must cast the spell before resolving either melee attack.\nIf [Fast Action] and [Multi-Action] are combined, it is possible to perform either combination twice.\nEven if you declare a combination with a Combat Feat that can attack multiple targets at the same time, such as [Cleave], you can only cast the spell once, regardless of how many melee attack targets you can get.\nIf you want to use both [Double Cast] and [Multi-Action], you need to declare both abilities at the same time to cast a spell.\nAfter this declaration, you can perform a [Double Cast] spell and melee attack combo. The person declaring the actions can choose the order in which they are performed.\nIt is important to note that if you declare [Multi-Action] before the melee attack, you cannot then declare [Double Cast], as the subsequent spell cast is not considered a Major Action.
