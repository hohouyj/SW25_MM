All such spells and abilities described in this book are used with Major Actions.If each section, rider, or mount can still perform further Actions, and they wish to perform them individually, do the following:1. Perform Minor Actions sequentially for each section. Movement and Major Actions cannot be performed.\n2. Breakthrough effect\n3. Make the next actions of each section sequentiallyFalling Off a Mount During a Collision while Riding\nIf a mounted character encounters some factor that impedes their movement, such as a wall or a cliff, then the rider/mount will hit the wall, fall off the cliff, or whatever is appropriate.Should a mount crash into a wall, all sections of both rider and mount suffer damage and fall prone. This will also cause the rider to fall from the mount (see CR III, p. 89), but in this case, the rider will not suffer damage for doing so.",
