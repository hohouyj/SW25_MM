The effect manifests if it's not an automatic failure.The Dark Hunter can extend one Soul Tether from themselves and use it like their own hand and arm. The Soul Tether can stretch up to \"Range: 1 (10m),\" grab objects, lift them, move them within the Soul Tether's range, and perform operations to the extent of what can be done with one hand. However, it cannot grab other characters or items they are equipping, holding, or owning. The Soul Tether can freely pass through gaps as narrow as a few centimeters wide but can only be operated within the Dark Hunter's line of sight.The strength and dexterity of the Soul Tether are determined by the Success Value of the skill check performed to use this Essence Weaving, treated as equivalent to the ability scores for strength and dexterity (if concerned about weight, consider that it can lift 5kg per 1 Success Value). With a sufficiently high Success Value, it's possible to grab objects fixed at high positions and even pull the Dark Hunter themselves up to those locations.The Dark Hunter cannot synchronize their own hands and arms with the Soul Tether. While using one, the other cannot be used. It's possible to wield a \"Stance: 1H\" weapon with the Soul Tether (using the Dark Hunter's Warrior-Type Classes and the strength and dexterity determined by the Success Value for Accuracy checks and damage determination), but this must be done as a Major Action, and the Dark Hunter cannot attack with their own weapon. [Dual Wielding] is also ineffective.If the Dark Hunter's HP decreases by even 1 point during the effect duration, whether from damage or consumption, this Essence Weaving is automatically dispelled.",
